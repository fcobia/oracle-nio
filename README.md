# OracleNIO

This driver is in a very early stage of development.

## Goals

A Oracle Driver/Client which is 100% written in Swift using SwiftNIO, communicating directly to Oracle DBs, without using Oracle Client Libraries.

Communication with Oracle DBs has no public documentation, because of that [python-oracledb](https://github.com/oracle/python-oracledb), especially the thin driver, is used as the main reference. 

> Contributions in any way are appreciated.
